 * Write an abstract superclass encapsulating a vehicle: A vehicle has two attributes: its ownerâ€™s
 * name and its number of wheels. This class has two non-abstract subclasses: one encapsulating
 * a Bicycle, and the other encapsulating a motorized vehicle. A motorized vehicle has the
 * following additional attributes: its engine volume displacement, in liters; and a method
 * computing and returning a measure of horsepower- the number of liters times the number of
 * wheels. You also need to include a client class to test the two classes.
