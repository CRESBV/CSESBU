 * Write a fully-documented class named Planner which stores an ordered list of Course objects. The array indices determine the preference of the courses (do not use ArrayList, Vector, or any other Java API Data Structures). A student can insert a course at any position within the range of the list. Make sure there are no gaps between courses on the list. Note that arrays in Java are 0 indexed, but your listing preference should start from 1. The Planner can record a total of 50 courses, so use the final variable MAX_COURSES = 50 (and refrain from using the number 50 within your code). The class will be based on the following ADT specification:
 */
public class Planner {
    private Course[] courseList
}
