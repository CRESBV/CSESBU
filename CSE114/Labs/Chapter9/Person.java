 * Design a class named Person and its two subclasses named Student and Employee. Make
 * Faculty and Staff subclasses of Employee. A person has a name, address, phone number, and
 * e-mail address. A student has a class status (freshman, sophomore, junior, or senior). Define
 * the status as a constant. An employee has an office, salary, and date hired. A faculty member
 * has office hours and a rank. A staff member has a title. Override the toString method in each
 * class to display the class name and the personâ€™s name.
 * Write a test program that creates a Person, Student, Employee, Faculty, and Staff, and invokes their
 * toString() methods.
