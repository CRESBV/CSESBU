 * Create a class called Rational for performing arithmetic with fractions. Write a program to
 * test your class. Use integer variables to represent the private instance variables of the class -
 * the numerator and the denominator. Provide a constructor that enables an object of this class
 * to be initialized when it’s declared. The constructor should store the fraction in reduced form.
 * The fraction
 * 2/4
 * is equivalent to 1/2 and would be stored in the object as 1 in the numerator and 2 in the
 * denominator. Provide a no-argument constructor with default values in case no initializers
 * are provided. Provide public methods that perform each of the following operations:
 * a) Add two Rational numbers: The result of the addition should be stored in reduced
 * form.
 * b) Subtract two Rational numbers: The result of subtraction should be stored in reduced
 * form.
 * c) Multiply two Rational numbers: The result of the multiplication should be stored in
 * reduced form.
 * d) Divide two Rational numbers: The result of the division should be stored in reduced
 * form.
 * e) Return a String representation of Rational number in the form 𝑎/𝑏, where 𝑎 is the
 * numerator and 𝑏 is the denominator.
 * Here is a sample run:
 * Enter numerator for the first rational number: 4
 * Enter a non-zero denominator for the first rational number: 6
 * Enter numerator for the second rational number: 1
 * Enter a non-zero denominator for the second rational number: 4
 * First rational number is: 2/3
 * Second rational number is: 1/4
 * Addition of the rational numbers is: 11/12
 * Subtraction of the rational numbers is: 5/12
 * Multiplication of the rational numbers is: 1/6
 * Division of the rational numbers is: 8/3
